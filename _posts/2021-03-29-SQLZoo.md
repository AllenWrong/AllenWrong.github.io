```

## 5. SUM and COUNT
**This tutorial is about aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM and AVG. An aggregate function takes many values and delivers just one value. For example the function SUM would aggregate the values 2, 4 and 5 to deliver the single value 11.**
**The difference of the 'HAVING' and 'WHERE': The HAVING clause is tested after the GROUP BY. The WHERE filter takes place before the aggregating function.**
1. Show the total population of the world.

```SQL
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM world
WHERE name in ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania')

```SQL
SELECT continent, COUNT(name) 'number of countries'
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
```
7. For each continent show the continent and number of countries with populations of at least 10 million.

SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
WHERE population >= 10000000
GROUP BY continent
```
8. List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.
```SQL
SELECT continent
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population) >= 100000000
```

GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1,team2
ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
```

```
9. List the films where 'Harrison Ford' has appeared - but not in the starring role. [Note: the ord field of casting gives the position of the actor. If ord=1 then this actor is in the starring role]
```SQL

                  WHERE name = 'Art Garfunkel') AND name != 'Art Garfunkel'
```

## 8. Using Null
**We can use the phrase IS NULL to pick out fields. We can use IS NOT NULL similarly.**
1. List the teachers who have NULL for their department.
```SQL
SELECT name
FROM teacher
WHERE dept IS NULL
```
2. Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher. (This example show that what the effect of INNER JOIN looks like.)
```SQL
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher 
INNER JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)
```
3. Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed. (This example show that what the effect of the left join looks like.)
```SQL
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)
```
4. Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed. (This example show that what the effect of the right join looks like.)
```SQL
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher
RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)
```
5. Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. 
```SQL
SELECT name, COALESCE(mobile, '07986 444 2266')
FROM teacher
```
6. Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.
```SQL
SELECT teacher.name, COALESCE(dept.name, 'None')
FROM teacher 
LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)
```
7. Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(name), COUNT(mobile)
FROM teacher
```
8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.
```SQL
SELECT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.name)
FROM teacher RIGHT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)
GROUP BY dept.name
```
9. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.
```SQL
SELECT teacher.name,
    CASE WHEN teacher.dept = 1
         THEN 'Sci'
         WHEN teacher.dept = 2
         THEN 'Sci'
         ELSE'Art'
    END
FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)
```
Or we can use the combination of condition like the following answer:
```SQL
SELECT teacher.name,
    CASE WHEN teacher.dept = 1 OR teacher.dept = 2
         THEN 'Sci'
         ELSE'Art'
    END
FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)
```
10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.
```SQL
SELECT teacher.name,
    CASE WHEN teacher.dept = 1 OR teacher.dept = 2
         THEN 'Sci'
         WHEN teacher.dept = 2
         THEN 'Art'
         ELSE'None'
    END
FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)
```

  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND (subject='(H) Creative Arts and Design'
